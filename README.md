# Our experience with building a Overstock clone
We are a group of 3 members who made a clone of this website within a week. This is our first project with Masai. Our team members are Aalesh Patil, Jitender Kumar, Binod Nayak, Md Irshad. This is the first time we have collaborated using GitHub.Thanks to Masai to made this project possible

# Technology we used:
HTML and CSS: Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications. Web developers use HTML keywords or tags to instruct the Web browser application on how to format and display the content of Web pages.

JavaScript (DOM): The Document Object Model, defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. With the Document Object Model, Developers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML document can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using the DOM.

# Challenges we faced :
we all are new to Github and javascript so understanding the concepts and applying them immediately is one of the major challenges.
we have to connect 2â€“3 times a day to meet for a discussion and track the project's progress.

# Our Workflow:
First, we shared our responsibility in the project, initiated the GitHub repository, and worked on our respective branches.
we used to connect daily if there is any problem
Finally, we merge each branch to the master branch.
So, we were successful in replicating Overstock . It was knowledgeable as well as a bit challenging, we learned a lot of new things while building and working as a team.

Thanks for reading.
